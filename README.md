Case labels are sized to work with Sony, TDK, and Maxell cases. Disk labels don't quite fit on Maxell discs but they will work. Sony and TDK are fine.

J-cards only work with the small jewel cases commonly found on eBay from Japan. They can be made either one panel or folded two panel, but pay attention to the thickness of the card stock on two panel j-cards. It may cause a tight fit with the disc in the case. J-card template has bleed area and cut/fold guides. The case label also works with these jewel cases, in tandem with the j-cards. There is a place for the label on the back side of the jewel case.
